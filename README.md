HOW TO USE THIS TO HOST THE SERVER YOURSELF 

-make sure you have JDK 17 installed 
-clone the repository to a folder on your desktop using the green button above 
-double click the 'run' windows batch file
-if it doesn't run properly there's some problem, contact me


TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER 

-go to whatsmyip.com and find your IPv4 address, you should be able to just enter that in the IP section of the 'connect to server' dialog in minecraft
-more advanced: run ipconfig -all in windows command prompt, find the adapter you're using to connect to the internet (either wireless or wired), and find your IPv4 address there
